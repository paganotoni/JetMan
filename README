Jetty instances manager

This started as a proof of concepts, the idea is to provide a simple REST api to manage different running application instances, and by manage i mean basic operations like START, and STOP.

Starting the application

Once you clone this repo you can start manager application by moving to the bin folder and running :

$ chmod +x start.sh
$ chmod +x stop.sh

$ ./start.sh

This will start application on port 4000

To stop application run stop script:

$ ./stop.sh
