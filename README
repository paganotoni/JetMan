Jetty instances manager

This started as a proof of concepts, the idea is to provide a simple REST api to manage different running application instances, and by manage i mean basic operations like START, and STOP.

Configuration

Application assumes you own a s3 bucket where you will store your application wars for deployment, application needs to have access to your bucket, this credentials can be set on aws-credentias.properties file, which initially will look like:

accessKey=[accessKey]
secretKey=[secretKey]

Theres also another file called manager-config.properties, it contains multiple settings related to the manager application.

[Important]
You must set 'runner.deployerFolder' to point the folder where you cloned InstanceManager before starting it.

Starting the application

Once you clone this repo you can start manager application by moving to the bin folder and running :

$ chmod +x start.sh
$ chmod +x stop.sh

$ ./start.sh

This will start application on port 4000

To stop application run stop script:

$ ./stop.sh
